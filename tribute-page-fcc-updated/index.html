                                <p>Leonardo da Vinci may well have been the greatest inventor in history, yet he had very little
                                    effect on the technology of his time. Da Vinci
                                    <strong>drew sketches and diagrams of his inventions</strong>, which he preserved in his notebooks,
                                    but either he lost interest in building them or was never able to convince one of his
                                    wealthy patrons to finance construction of his designs.</p>

                                <p>As an invention, the
                                    <strong>ball bearing</strong> doesn't seem all that impressive, but much of modern technology
                                    depends on it.</p>

                                <p>The speed at which a body falls depends on
                                    <strong>two factors:</strong> the force of the gravity pulling it downward and the resistance
                                    of the atmosphere through which it is falling. </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Da Vinci was fascinated by birds. He watched them, sketched them and borrowed ideas from
                                    them for his inventions. One of the results of this fascination was the
                                    <strong>ornithopter</strong>, a device conceived by da Vinci that would theoretically have allowed
                                    humans to soar through the air like birds. </p>

                                <p> Da Vinci's machine gun, or
                                    <strong>"33-barrelled organ,"</strong> wasn't a machine gun in the modern sense. It couldn't
                                    fire multiple bullets rapidly out of a single barrel. </p>

                                <p> While living in Venice in the late
                                    <strong>15th century</strong>, da Vinci devised a far-fetched idea for repelling invading ships:
                                    Send men to the bottom of the harbor in diving suits and let them cut holes in enemy
                                    hulls. </p>
                            </li>

                        <div>

                                <p>While working for Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, da Vinci proposed what may have been his
                                    <strong>ultimate war machine:</strong> the armored tank. Driven by the muscle power of eight
                                    men, the armored tank was a turtle-like moving shell with 36 guns poking out of its sides.</p>
